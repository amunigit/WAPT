# WAPT
Cross-Platform Web Application Performance Testing in Java

This project is about developing a simple customizable Web Application Performance Testing tool in Java bundled with Server side files that allows for easy deployment and load testing of a servers performance of desired functionality or to add prototype methods and determine thier performance


Config Files that direct the testing are the .properties files in the Resource folder of the Main WAPT folder
WAPT runnable is the compiled jar files that need the corresponding .bat and Resource folder in the same directory to be run.

Currently there is no option to test other types of web applications in a form other than HTML get and POST.

To add your own test, add your .properties file in the Resource folder with format corresponding to the HTMLConfig examples.
